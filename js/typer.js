/* ==========================================================================
 * typer.js -- "words ease in"
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A typewriter in PACING only. It lands a word at a time, and each word fades
 * up and unblurs where it already sits. Nothing reflows while a line arrives,
 * and the line always finishes on time even on slow frames.
 *
 * The three ideas that make it look smooth:
 *
 *   1. LAYOUT FIRST, REVEAL SECOND. The whole line is written into the DOM up
 *      front, one <span class="wd"> per word, all at opacity 0. Revealing only
 *      adds a class. Because every word already occupies its final box, no
 *      word ever pushes another sideways as it appears -- which is exactly
 *      what makes a character-by-character typewriter on a centred line look
 *      so jittery.
 *
 *   2. A HIDDEN GHOST RESERVES THE WIDTH. A visibility:hidden copy of the line
 *      sits in normal flow and gives the wrapper its final width and height;
 *      the live line is absolutely positioned on top of it. So a centred or
 *      wrapping line never shifts, and the box never grows as the text
 *      arrives. The ghost is built with the SAME span-per-word structure as
 *      the live line, not as a plain text node: a plain run can differ by a
 *      hair in width and wrap one word earlier than the live line does.
 *
 *   3. PACED AGAINST A WALL CLOCK, not a chain of timeouts. Each word is due
 *      at start + charsBefore * perChar, and before each word we sleep only
 *      the REMAINING time to its due moment. A dropped frame or a slow paint
 *      costs nothing; drift never accumulates. Pacing stays per character
 *      even though reveal is per word, so a long word naturally holds the
 *      line a little longer.
 *
 * Cancellation is Flow's: every sleep here is taken out through Flow.wait, so
 * a scene change unwinds a half-typed line along with the rest of the chain,
 * and Skip makes the line land whole and instantly with no special case here.
 * The `gen` guard is the second line of defence -- it stops an orphaned line
 * from writing into a box a newer line now owns.
 *
 * Load order: js/flow.js -> js/typer.js

     A bubble sized by its own text changes shape between one line and the

     as a glitch. Flip measures both boxes and eases between them while the
     words -- already laid out, still invisible -- wait inside. scale:false on
     purpose: a scaled bubble would stretch its border and its corner radius
     along with it.

     REPLACING a line only. The first line into an empty box is not a morph
     -- there is no previous size to come from -- and running one anyway is
     actively harmful: Flip restores whatever inline styles the element had
     when it took over, so a Flip overlapping the bubble's own opening tween
     puts the bubble back to closed the moment it finishes. `had` is what
