/* ==========================================================================
 * flow.js -- the scene clock
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A scene here is one long `await` chain: say a line, wait a beat, draw a
 * shape, wait for a tap. That reads well, but it needs an answer to one
 * question -- what happens to the rest of the chain when the scene is
 * abandoned half way through?
 *
 * Every wait in the game is taken out through this file and stamped with the
 * scene token that was current when it was asked for. Flow.reset() bumps the
 * token and REJECTS every wait still outstanding, which unwinds the whole
 * chain in one go: no orphaned line ever writes into a box the next scene now
 * owns, and no timeout fires into a torn-down board.
 *
 * Skip is the other half of the same idea and the opposite answer: the waits
 * RESOLVE, immediately, and everything already in the air is jumped to its
 * end by Motion.skip(). The chain then plays itself out in a handful of
 * frames and lands in exactly the state it would have reached anyway -- with
 * no special case anywhere in the scenes themselves.
 *
 * Load order: libs/gsap.min.js -> js/motion.js -> js/flow.js
 * ========================================================================== */
